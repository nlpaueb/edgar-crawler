# EDGAR-CRAWLER: Extract Key Financial Data from SEC Filings Effortlessly üöÄ
![EDGAR-CRAWLER-LOGO](images/edgar-crawler-logo-white-bg.jpeg)


**EDGAR-CRAWLER** is the only open-source toolkit that **downloads** **raw** and unstructured financial **SEC filings** from EDGAR and converts them **into** **structured JSON files** in order to **bootstrap financial NLP** experiments.

---

**EDGAR-CRAWLER** has 2 core functionalities:
- üì• **Seamless downloading**: Retrieve and download financial filings from all US publicly-traded companies based on your specified filters, like year, quarters, filing type, etc.
- üîç **Structured JSON output**: Extract and parse specific key sections from 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings into a nice-and-easy standardized JSON format.  *(filings supported: 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K)*


## üö® News
- 2024/10: We now support **structured JSON output for 10-Q and 8-K** filings. ([@Bailefan](https://github.com/Bailefan))
- 2023/12: We had a Lightning Talk about EDGAR-CRAWLER at the 3rd Workshop for Natural Language Processing Open Source Software [(NLP-OSS)](https://nlposs.github.io/2023/), hosted at EMNLP 2023, in Singapore.
- 2023/01: EDGAR-CORPUS, the biggest financial NLP corpus (generated from EDGAR-CRAWLER!), is available as a HuggingFace ü§ó dataset card. See [Accompanying Resources](#Accompanying-Resources).
- 2022/10: Updated documentation and fixed a minor import bug affecting older Python versions.
- 2022/04: EDGAR-CRAWLER is available for Windows systems too.
- 2021/11: We presented EDGAR-CORPUS, our "parent" project that started it all, at [ECONLP 2021](https://lt3.ugent.be/econlp/) (EMNLP Workshop) at the Dominican Republic. See [Accompanying Resources](#Accompanying-Resources) for more details. An early/alpha version of EDGAR-CRAWLER was built for that project.

## Example JSON Outputs
Other than downloading the raw filings, **EDGAR-CRAWLER** is the only open-source toolkit that converts the complex and unstructured SEC filings to **structured JSON outputs** for easier integration to your research and development. Below are examples of such outputs for each supported filing type:

## Install

- Download `EDGAR-CRAWLER` locally via SSH or HTTPS:
```bash
# Method 1: SSH 
git clone https://github.com/nlpaueb/edgar-crawler.git 

# Method 2: HTTPS
git clone git@github.com:nlpaueb/edgar-crawler.git
```

- Then, it's recommended to create a new virtual environment using Python 3.8 by [installing and using Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).
```bash
conda create -n edgar-crawler-venv python=3.8 # After installing Anaconda, create a venv with python 3.8+
conda activate edgar-crawler-venv # Activate the environment
```

- Then, install the toolkit's dependencies via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install requirements for edgar-crawler
```

## Usage
- Before running any script, you should edit the `config.json` file, which configures the behavior of our 2 modules (one for downloading the filings of your choice, the other one for getting the structured output of them). 
  - Arguments for `download_filings.py`, the module to download financial reports:
      - `start_year XXXX`: the year range to start from (default is 2023).
      - `end_year YYYY`: the year range to end to (default is 2023).
      - `quarters`: the quarters that you want to download filings from (List).<br> Default value is: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
      - `filing_types`: list of filing types to download.<br> Default value is: `['10-K', '8-K', '10-Q']`.
      - `cik_tickers`: list or path of file containing CIKs or Tickers. e.g. `[789019, "1018724", "AAPL", "TWTR"]` <br>
        In case of file, provide each CIK or Ticker in a different line.  <br>
      If this argument is not provided, then the toolkit will download annual reports for all the U.S. publicly traded companies.
      - `user_agent`: the User-agent (name/email) that will be declared to SEC EDGAR.
      - `raw_filings_folder`: the name of the folder where downloaded filings will be stored.<br> Default value is `'RAW_FILINGS'`.
      - `indices_folder`: the name of the folder where EDGAR TSV files will be stored. These are used to locate the annual reports. Default value is `'INDICES'`.
      - `filings_metadata_file`: CSV filename to save metadata from the reports.
      - `non_periodic_filing_types`: filing types that do not have period of report (e.g. 144).
      - `skip_present_indices`: Whether to skip already downloaded EDGAR indices or download them nonetheless.<br> Default value is `True`.
  - Arguments for `extract_items.py`, the module to clean and extract textual data from already-downloaded reports:
    - `raw_filings_folder`: the name of the folder where the downloaded documents are stored.<br> Default value s `'RAW_FILINGS'`.
    - `extracted_filings_folder`: the name of the folder where extracted documents will be stored.<br> Default value is `'EXTRACTED_FILINGS'`.<br> For each downloaded report, a corresponding JSON file will be created containing the item sections as key-pair values.
    - `filings_metadata_file`: CSV filename to load reports metadata (Provide the same csv file as in `download_filings.py`).
    - `filing_types`: list of filing types to extract.
    - `include_signature`: Whether to include the signature section after the last item or not.
    - `items_to_extract`: a list with the certain item sections to extract. <br>
      e.g. `['7','8']` to extract 'Management‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis' and 'Financial Statements' section items for 10-K reports.<br>
      By default, this list is empty, in which case all items are extracted.
    - `remove_tables`: Whether to remove tables containing mostly numerical (financial) data. This work is mostly to facilitate NLP research where, often, numerical tables are not useful.
    - `skip_extracted_filings`: Whether to skip already extracted filings or extract them nonetheless.<br> Default value is `True`.

- To download the raw financial reports from EDGAR, run `python download_filings.py`.
- To clean and extract specific item sections from already-downloaded documents, run `python extract_items.py`.
  - Reminder: **We currently support the structured JSON output for 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K documents.**
  - Note: For older 10-Q filings, it might not be possible to extract any items for specific parts (Part 1 or Part 2). Because of this, we also include each full `part` in the output file as a separate entry.
